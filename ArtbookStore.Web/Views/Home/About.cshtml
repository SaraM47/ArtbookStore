    <h1>About SumiFolio</h1>
        <p>
            SumiFolio Bookstore was created from a deep love for visual storytelling and artistic expression. 
            It is a curated space where illustration, animation, and creative books meet thoughtful design.
        </p>
        <p>
            We focus on the who, what, and why behind every artbook — celebrating the artists, their journeys, 
            and the stories that shape their work. Each collection is carefully selected to inspire, educate, 
            and bring beauty into everyday life.

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            The inspiration behind SumiFolio comes from the quiet magic of artbooks, the way they 
            capture imagination, preserve process, and showcase the depth behind every creative work. This bookstore was built to celebrate that magic. A space where art lives not only on screens, 
            but in pages you can hold, revisit, and treasure.
